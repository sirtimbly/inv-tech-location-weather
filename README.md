# inv-tech-location-weather

## Installation

1. Clone thus repo locally and then `cd` into the cloned project directory.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Build the files with `npm run build`

## Configuration

The list of locations is stored in `locations.json` â€“ edit this file to get additonal results.

## Running

From the command line, in the root project directory, run `node dist/index.js`

  Alternately you can run the .ts files diretly with `ts-node src/index.ts`

The ouput will be printed to the terminal. The output is meant to be comma seperated values, so you can pipe the output to a new .csv file and open as a spreadsheet.

## Note

The API Key from Accuweather is on a very limited trial. You may use up all the API calls quickly. That's one reason for caching location codes to disk.

This is a coding exercise.
